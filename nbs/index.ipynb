    "\n",
    "AlphaMap is a tool for peptide level MS data exploration. You can load and inspect MS data analyzed by [AlphaPept](https://github.com/MannLabs/alphapept), DIA-NN, MaxQuant, Spectronaut or FragPipe. Uploaded data is processed and formatted for visual inspection of the sequence coverage of any selected protein and its identified post-translational modifications (PTMs). UniProt information is available to directly annotate sequence regions of interest such as protein domains, secondary structures, sequence variants, known PTMs, etc. Additionally, users can select proteases to further evaluate the distribution of proteolytic cleavage sites across a protein sequence. The functionality of AlphaMap can be accessed via an intuitive graphical user interface or - more flexibly - as a Python package that allows its integration into common analysis workflows for data visualization. \n"

    "There are three different types of installation possible:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [**One-click GUI installer:**](#one-click-gui) Choose this installation if you only want the GUI and/or keep things as simple as possible.\n",
    "* [**Pip installer:**](#pip) Choose this installation if you want to use AlphaMap as a Python package in an existing Python 3.8 environment (e.g. a Jupyter notebook). If needed, the GUI can be installed with pip as well.\n",
    "* [**Developer installer:**](#developer) Choose this installation if you are familiar with CLI tools, [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) and Python. This installation allows access to all available features of AlphaMap and even allows to modify its source code directly.\n"

For Windows, a system update might be necessary in case older versions do not work. To prevent installation errors on **Windows**, we recommend **uninstalling the previous AlphaMap version before installing a new one**."
